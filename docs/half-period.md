## Project Milestones Achieved

Alot was discussed over the past weeks including the licensing, the code approaches and directory structures.
To summarize, here's a list of things I was able to do so far:

- Shift code from LGPL 2.1 to Apache 2 License. This license is finally zephyr compatible!
- This allowed us to shift development upstream to [zephyr/gsoc-2022-arduino-core](https://github.com/zephyrproject-rtos/gsoc-2022-arduino-core)
- Remove the core directory from the actual repo.
