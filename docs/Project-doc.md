# Arduino Core API module Documentation

This module provides an abstraction layer that enables Arduino IDE style C++ code to use underlying zephyr OS to program an Arduino BLE Sense 33. This project is still under development stage.

## Arduino Nano ble sense 33

The pinout for the arduino board that I am testing this project on is given below: ![](https://docs.arduino.cc/static/4c1da40b06b866435315963ef6bdf488/ABX00030-pinout.png)

The reason for choosing this board is that it is widely available and the chip Nordic nRF52x supports zephyr natively in their SDK.
