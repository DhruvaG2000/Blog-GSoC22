# Week 1

(23rd May - 30th May)
- GSoC proposal is accepted.
- Community Bonding Period begins
- Setup zephyr and zephyr SDK on my local machine.
- Create this project blog.
- Reached out to mentor regarding the following:
    1. Upstream Repo (Should I create it on my own ID or will it be a zephyr repo?)
    2. Suitable Timezone and Time of communication in a day and when we can take weekly discussions? (I am in IST Timezone and am available from 10AM IST to 11PM IST till the month of July)
    3. Which microcontroller should we target as the first Proof of Concept for this project? (Imo a Development kit would be most helpful like an nRF52-DK perhaps? Nordic also has native support for Zephyr so maybe things will also be easier from drivers and community support POV.)
    4. Should we create another discord channel for this project to filter conversation and keep it project related? It will make communication much more easier. Let me know your preference for the mode of communication. (For eg. during my last year's project I mainly used Slack threads and email with my mentor) 
- Read the soburi/arduino-on-zephyr repo and tried to build a sample blinky app. This failed with errors that I have elaborated on here - https://github.com/soburi/arduino-on-zephyr/issues/26 .
- Started reading the Arduino API and study how to use it.
- Started maintaining my own repo [here](https://github.com/DhruvaG2000/Arduino-Core-Zephyr) to record progress and module.
- Wrote "hello world" example where I included Arduino_API and checked that including the module doesn't cause any build errors.
